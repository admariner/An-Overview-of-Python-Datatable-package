# An Overview of Python's Datatable package
Python library for efficient multi-threaded data processing, with the support for out-of-memory datasets.


## Installation

On MacOS systems installing datatable is as easy as
```sh
pip install datatable
```

On Linux you can install a binary distribution as
```sh
# If you have Python 3.5
pip install https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/datatable/stable/datatable-0.8.0/datatable-0.8.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl

# If you have Python 3.6
pip install https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/datatable/stable/datatable-0.8.0/datatable-0.8.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

On all other platforms a source distribution will be needed. For more
